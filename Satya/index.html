                        1. Semi circular hostel (SCH) - From the food there to the TV room to open feel, I loved the experience. And walking distance to campus, temple across etc.. made it memorable.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-0">
                        2. Karaikudi- A complete tranquil village look and feel - being able to peacefully walk or bicycle anywhere without too much traffic, through fields, to go from campus to one of the many food ‚Äúmesses‚Äù/houses, have masala paal, go to pillaiyaar pettai temple etc‚Ä¶

                        3. The peaceful and secluded locations around college campus to go study, quietly read and just get away, especially in the cooler evenings, with almost every location having traditional clay water pots that naturally cool water (no electricity).

                    <p class="mb-0">
                        4. Utopia trip - memorable trip, with all the places from kanyakumari to ooty , train rides (almost missing one) - and the 2 to 3 days of nonstop sleeping after we got back / totally exhausted.üò¥

                        5. The A/C computer lab on campus, which looked and sounded so cool and high tech back thenüòÄ.

                        6. Last but not least, my yellow futuristic looking bike / cycle (mountain bike style) - my 1st and most expensive possession back then - which I‚Äôll never forget.
